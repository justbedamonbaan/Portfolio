What i learned so far:

react is a javascript library that has prebuilt components and hooks to call in.
node.js is more like a runtime envoirment with more back end properties also serves as a framework
vite is a tool to compile and optimize your code for production, resulting in faster build times and smaller bundle sizes

how i created my project
npm create vite@latest my-portfolio -- --template react
cd my-portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
